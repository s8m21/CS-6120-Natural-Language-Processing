# CS-6120-Natural-Language-Processing

Natural Language Processing field covers a diverse range of tasks, methods and language models for making computers understand language and help us achieve certain goals such as document classification, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, named-entity-recognition (NER), information extraction and machine translation. This course will impart learning how these goals are achieved using different unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods such as; maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE), matrix factorization, perceptron, logistic regression and backpropagation. The contents of this course are designed with assumption that you have a decent background in statistics, multivariate calculus and linear algebra: probabilistic inference, random variables, vectors, matrices, derivatives, and partial derivatives. The ultimate aim of this course is to assess, develop and evaluate NLP solutions within the context of real world applications such as sentiment analysis, information retrieval and chatbots.

This repository stores and highlights natural language processing assignments as a reference for learners pursuing the course to provide guidance and support.
